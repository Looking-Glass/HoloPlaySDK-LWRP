## HoloPlay SDK LWRP
This is the start of an experimental branch of the HoloPlay SDK using the LWRP. As of March 28 2019, it's in its initial stages, with only basic support working, but hopefully we will make some progress with instanced rendering and offer some significant optimizations in the future.

The reason it is being distributed as a project folder is because we will likely be making some edits directly to the LWRP itself, and it's easier for a user to just clone the whole project than be guided through the steps of setting that up themselves.

### How to use
Clone project and open with Unity 2019.1 or later.
