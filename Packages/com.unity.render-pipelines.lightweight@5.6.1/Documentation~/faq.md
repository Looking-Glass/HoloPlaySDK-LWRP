# FAQ 



### Can I no longer use information from the Unity Manual?

Oh, please do! We reused as much as possible of the built-in Unity render pipeline. The Graphics section of the Unity Manual still has a lot of good stuff. In the documentation for LWRP, you'll find cross references to  the Graphics manual, whenever something's already explained there. 

### So what do I need this documentation for? 

Because this is where you'll read specifically about LWRP. Because LWRP is a package that requires for you to download, we're keeping the docs specific to that package separate from the general user Manual. 

### Can I use LWRP and HDRP at the same time?

No. They're both built on the Scriptable Render Pipelines, but their render paths and light models are different. 

### Can I convert from one pipeline to the other?

Yes! To do so, you'll have to re-write your assets and revisit your lighting strategy for your game or app.
