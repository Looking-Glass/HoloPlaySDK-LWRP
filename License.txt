Thank you for your interest in using the LKG Software Development Kit (the "Looking Glass 
SDK", “HoloPlay SDK”, or collectively, “SDK”). The “SDK” as defined herein includes any 
subsequent updates or upgrades made available to you, and any associated documentation, 
software code, or other materials made available by LGF to you in the LKG Software 
Development Kit. In order to obtain and use the SDK, you must first agree to the terms of this 
License. This License is an agreement between you and Looking Glass Factory Inc. (“LGF”), and 
you agree that this License is enforceable like any written and negotiated agreement signed by 
you and that your use of the SDK constitutes acceptance of the License terms. If you do not 
agree to the terms of this License, then you may not use the SDK.
This Agreement does not govern the use of other services or products provided by LGF other 
than the SDK. 
1.  SDK LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS
1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of, and your ongoing compliance with, this License, 
LGF hereby grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, license to use, 
reproduce, modify, distribute and create derivative works of the software contained in 
the SDK. Under this License, you may: 
1.1.1 download, install, and use the SDK on your devices solely to design, develop and test

into your Content and solely to the extent necessary for others to use your Content.

your Content; and

law allows you to decompile or otherwise disassemble the SDK in order to render the

Looking Glass display users or developers that would induce breach of any LGF 
agreements, including without limitation this License, or (c) provide software to 
HoloPlayer One or Looking Glass display users that contains malware, viruses, hacks, 
bots, Trojan horses, or other malicious code; or
1.3.8 use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this License.
2. OWNERSHIP
2.1  The SDK is licensed and not sold to you, and LGF retains and reserves all other rights not 
granted under this License. LGF retains complete ownership of any and all intellectual property 
rights in and to the SDK, and no title to the SDK or any intellectual property of LGF is transferred 
to you under this License. You do not acquire any rights to the SDK except as expressly granted 
herein. 
2.2  Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 2.1, you retain all rights to your Content, and you 
have no obligations to share or license your Content (including your source and object code) to 
LGF or any third parties; provided, however, LGF retains all rights to the SDK and the headers,

available by LGF, including those that may be incorporated into your Content by virtue of your 
producing it through the SDK.
3. GENERAL PROVISIONS
3.1  LGF may include in the SDK additional content for demonstration, references or other 
specific purposes. Such content will be clearly marked in the SDK and is subject to this License 
and any included terms and conditions.
3.2  Your use of third-party materials included in the SDK, or which the SDK may be 
dependent upon (including without limitation, any open-source code and the Unity game 
engine), may be subject to other terms and conditions typically found in separate third-party 
license agreements or license files included with such third-party materials. To the extent such 
other terms and conditions conflict with the terms and conditions of this License, the former 
will control with respect to the applicable third-party materials.  The terms of licensing the 
Unity game engine can be found here: https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service/software.
3.3 THE SDK AND ANY COMPONENT THEREOF ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ANY EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT 
SHALL LGF OR ITS AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR 
PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SDK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGE. Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of implied 
warranties, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you in such case. Notwithstanding 
anything herein to the contrary, LGF’s liability to you under this License shall be limited to the 
total amount paid by you for the SDK, if any. 
3.4.  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service 
marks, or product names of LGF, including without limitation LOOKING GLASS, HOLOPLAYER 
ONE and HOLOPLAY SDK, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
origin of the SDK, and reproducing the content of the License Notice file. Neither LGF’s name 
nor the names of LGF’s contributors, licensors, employees, or contractors, may be used to 
endorse or promote products developed using the SDK without the specific prior written 
permission of LGF.
3.5.  You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the SDK and your Content complies
with all applicable laws (including privacy laws) wherever your Content is made available. You 
acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any health and safety issues arising 
from your Content.
3.6 As this License is updated from time to time for future releases of the SDK, you agree to 
abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this License for those future SDK 
releases, with acceptance evidenced by usage of the SDK or any element thereof and the future 
updates of this License will apply for your Content that may be developed for or with that 
future SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out of the requirements of future 
updates of the License by developing against an older release of the SDK or License).  You 
acknowledge that future versions of the SDK may be provided for a fee or otherwise under 
substantially different terms from those provided hereunder.
3.7. This License shall continue until it is terminated. LGF reserves the right to terminate this 
License and all your rights hereunder immediately, and without advance notice, in the event 
you materially breach this License. On termination, you must delete all versions, copies and 
downloads of the SDK in your possession and you may not register for another copy of the SDK 
under a new license, unless LGF permits otherwise. Additionally, LGF reserves the right to 
cancel or terminate this License for any of the following reasons:
3.7.1 If your Content is accused of infringing on a third party’s intellectual property;
3.7.2 If your Content violates applicable law, regulation or rule;
3.7.3 If your Content causes health or safety risks;
3.7.4 If you use the SDK with a commercial product other than HoloPlayer One, Looking Glass or 
3.7.5 Unity; and
3.7.6 If you fail to comply with this License.
3.8.  You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless LGF from any and all claims, 
losses, costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of your 
Content or any breach of this License.
3.9 LGF may discontinue or change functionality of the SDK at any time, and your continued 
use of HoloPlayer One, Looking Glass or the SDK or use of any modified or additional services in 
connection therewith is conditioned upon your adherence to the terms of this License, as 
modified by LGF from time to time, as well as any additional license agreements necessitated 
by additional features.
3.10. In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, prohibited or 
unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, this License shall be 
construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision has been more narrowly 
drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable.
3.11 You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without the advance 
written consent of LGF, which may be withheld in its sole discretion. LGF may assign its rights or 
obligations under this License in its sole discretion.
3.12 Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this License will not 
be construed as a waiver of such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or 
parts thereof.
3.13 Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect money damages, if 
any, and you hereby waive your right to injunctive or other equitable relief.
3.14 You will comply with all applicable export control laws of the United States and any other 
applicable governmental authority, including without limitation, the U.S. Export Administration 
Regulations. You agree that this License and the SDK and accompanying documentation are 
LGF’s confidential information (and is not publicly available), and you will not use it, disclose it 
or make it available to others except in accordance with the terms of this License.
3.15 This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect 
to choice of law principles. All disputes relating to this License shall be resolved by binding nonappearance-based arbitration before a single arbitrator in New York County, New York. The 
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of JAMS then in 
effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final and capable of entry in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. You and LGF agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts 
located within New York County, New York in connection with any entrance of an arbitrator’s 
judgment or decision or any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure or 
LGF’s exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.
